# eBook app backend and frontend automated tests (using Postman and Selenium)

This is project based on simple eBook rental app (created by Kodilla).

https://github.com/kodilla/ta-ebooklibrary-backend/tree/master/src/main/java/com/kodilla/ebooklibrary/controller 

I put files with tests scenarios (using Gherkin, because of its versatility) in "resources" directory.
Also, there are Postman collections with endpoints tests.
